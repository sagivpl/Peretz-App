# MongoDB Integration Status

## Current Status
✅ **App is working** - Using mock data as fallback
✅ **MongoDB is running** - Local instance at localhost:27017
✅ **Database is seeded** - Has users, matches, and predictions data
✅ **API structure created** - Ready for backend integration

## Issue Identified
The original implementation tried to connect directly from the browser to MongoDB, which is not possible due to:
- Security restrictions (browsers can't make direct TCP connections)
- MongoDB driver is designed for Node.js server environments
- CORS and network security policies

## Current Solution
The app is now using the mock data API as a fallback, ensuring it works immediately while we set up the proper backend.

## Next Steps for MongoDB Integration

### Option 1: Express.js Backend API
Create a separate backend server:
```bash
# Create backend directory
mkdir ../peretz-backend
cd ../peretz-backend
npm init -y
npm install express mongodb cors

# Use the MongoDB API classes we created in src/services/api/
# Create REST endpoints that the frontend can call
```

### Option 2: Use MongoDB MCP
Since you mentioned having MongoDB MCP, you can:
1. Configure the MCP to expose HTTP endpoints
2. Update `src/services/api/httpClient.ts` to use those endpoints
3. Switch the main API service to use httpClient instead of mock data

### Option 3: Serverless Functions
Use Vercel/Netlify functions or similar to create API endpoints that connect to MongoDB.

## Files Ready for Backend Integration

- `src/services/mongodb.ts` - MongoDB connection utility
- `src/services/api/users.ts` - Users API implementation  
- `src/services/api/matches.ts` - Matches API implementation
- `src/services/api/predictions.ts` - Predictions API implementation
- `src/services/api/httpClient.ts` - HTTP client for frontend-backend communication

## How to Switch to Real Backend

When your backend is ready, simply update `src/services/api/index.ts`:

```typescript
// Replace this line:
import { getUsers, getMatches, getPredictions, createPrediction } from '../mockData';

// With this:
import { httpApiClient } from './httpClient';

// Then update each method to use httpApiClient instead of mock functions
```

The app structure is ready - you just need to choose your backend approach!
